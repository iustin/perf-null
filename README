This is a set of small programs for testing startup costs using perf.

Yes, this is mostly pointless, but it was fun to do it and to look at
the numbers.

You'll need lots of packages installed to make all of the programs to
work. They should all be available in (Debian) Sid:

- java: openjdk-6-jdk openjdk-6-jre-zero icedtea-6-jre-cacao icedtea-6-jre-jamvm gcj-4.6
- python: python2.6 python2.7 python3.2 pypy
- etc.

Main target is "make log", and it is recommended to run in in
single-user mode, and with an idle system. For consistency, also force
the make run on a single CPU (this might make things a tad slower, but
the results should be more stable).
